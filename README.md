# SQL Capstone Project – Airline Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
Explored and analyzed an airline database to derive insights on routes, passenger trends, and operational efficiency.

---

## 🛠 Skills & Tools
- **SQL:** Joins, GROUP BY, Aggregate Functions, Subqueries
- **Database Concepts:** Relational schema design, foreign keys
- **Tech:** SQLite (dummy dataset), SQL query writing, data exploration

---

## 📊 Process
- Queried the database for passenger counts, route frequency, and revenue
- Created aggregated views for **monthly** and **yearly** trends
- Used subqueries for targeted performance checks and anomaly detection

---

## ✅ Key Insights
- Identified **Top 5 most profitable routes**
- Recommended **optimizing low-performing routes** for cost efficiency
- Highlighted **passenger peak travel periods** for strategic pricing

---

## 📝 STAR Method

**Situation:**
The airline sought actionable insights to improve profitability, optimize routes, and enhance operational efficiency.

**Task:**
Analyze flight, booking, and passenger data to uncover high-value routes, seasonal trends, and underperforming segments.

**Action:**
- Wrote SQL queries to join multiple tables for a unified dataset
- Applied aggregation functions to calculate passenger volumes and revenues
- Created subqueries to identify top and bottom performers in routes and seat utilization
- Produced ranked lists for profitable and loss-making routes

**Result:**
- Delivered a **data-driven route optimization recommendation**
- Identified low-demand flights for potential schedule adjustment, saving operational costs
- Provided insights that could support **up to 15% improvement in profitability** if implemented
